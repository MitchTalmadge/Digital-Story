                Pictured is the Rio Grande Depot, built in 1910 for the Denver Rio Grande and Western Railroad. It was
                the railroad's "main jewel," and was purposely designed to surpass the Salt Lake City Union Pacific
                Depot.<br/>
                The depot opened SLC to immigration, and served as a central point for sending soldiers to war in WWI
                and WWII.<br/>
                Today, the Rio Grande Depot is the home to many of Utah's state history offices, the Utah History
                Research Center, the Rio Gallery, and the Rio Grande Cafe.<br/>
